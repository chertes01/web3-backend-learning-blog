# PoS (Proof of Stake) Study Notes

The core idea of PoS comes from the corporate shareholding system: the more shares you hold, the higher your probability of earning returns. In blockchain, PoS nodes participate in consensus by staking a certain amount of cryptocurrency, and gain the right and reward to produce new blocks based on their stake and coin age.

## 1. Basic Concepts

- **Validator**: A node participating in consensus, becoming part of the validator set by staking cryptocurrency.
- **Coinage**: Represents the time accumulation after cryptocurrency is staked as shares, calculated as:
```yaml
Coinage = k * balance * age
```

- The greater the coinage, the higher the probability of generating a block.  
- After coins are used, their coinage is consumed.

## 2. Consensus Process

1. Nodes submit their stake to become validators.  
2. The system selects the next block producer based on coinage and hash difficulty.  
3. The node consumes minimal computational resources to generate a block and receive rewards.

## 3. Challenges Faced by PoS

| Issue                | Description                                         | Solution / Risk                        |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Nothing at Stake** | Nodes can produce blocks at low cost, hard to limit forks | Introduce penalty mechanisms or lock-up deposits |
| **Long Range Attack**| Historical overwrite attacks, can replace the main chain | Monitor timestamps, periodic snapshots, protect old validator private keys |
| **Cold Start Problem** | Nodes with high coinage have priority, leading to hoarding | Use PoW at the beginning → PoW+PoS → full PoS |

## 4. Practical Applications of PoS

- **Peercoin**: Hybrid PoW + PoS consensus  
- **NXT**: Fully PoS public chain  
- **Tendermint**: Deposit voting mechanism, theoretically guarantees Byzantine fault tolerance  
- **LPoS (Leased PoS)**: Leasing stake to solve small node participation, shared rewards, e.g., Waves  
- **DPoS (Delegated PoS)**: Delegated Proof of Stake, introduced in the next section

## 5. Summary

1. **Advantages**  
 - Low energy consumption: does not require massive computing power  
 - Reasonable incentives: token holders participate in consensus and earn rewards  
 - Natural inflation: new coin issuance is related to stake  

2. **Disadvantages**  
 - Still faces risks of historical attacks and forks  
 - Cold start is difficult, initial PoW support is needed  
 - Large holders may concentrate and affect network fairness  

> **Conclusion**: PoS is a highly energy-efficient consensus mechanism suitable for long-term maintenance, but it requires incentive design, fork protection, and historical verification methods to ensure security and decentralization in real-world
